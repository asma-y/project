      <p > <font size="4" color="black">Computer engineering (CoE or CpE) is a branch of engineering that integrates several fields of computer science and electronic <br>
        engineering required to develop computer hardware and software. Computer engineers usually have training in electronic engineering <br>
        (or electrical engineering), software design, and hardware-software integration instead of only software engineering or electronic <br>
        engineering. Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing, from the design of individual<br>
         microcontrollers, microprocessors, personal computers, and supercomputers, to circuit design. This field of engineering not only <br>
        focuses on how computer systems themselves work but also how they integrate into the larger picture</font>
