  What do computer engineers do? Broadly speaking, computer engineering is a<br>
   mixture of computer science and electrical engineering. Everything from<br>
    designing software/systems/networks to implementing algorithms to security <br>
    maintenance is the job of a computer engineer. Meeting the technological and<br>
     administrative needs of the industry is the final goal, but this definition may well <br>
     be applied to various other professions, too.<br>


Here we need to go back to the question what is computer engineering. Among others, <br>
computer engineers may specialize in operating systems, computer<br>
 networks, information systems, computer architecture, computer design and engineering, and software.<br>
