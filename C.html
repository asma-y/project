        Computer engineering began in 1939 when John Vincent Atanasoff and Clifford Berry began developing the world's first electronic digital <br>
        computer through physics, mathematics, and electrical engineering. John Vincent Atanasoff was once a physics and mathematics teacher for<br>
         Iowa State University and Clifford Berry a former graduate under electrical engineering and physics. Together, they created the Atanasoff-Berry computer, <br>
         also known as the ABC which took 5 years to complete.[7] While the original ABC was dismantled and discarded in the 1940s a tribute was made to the late inventors, a replica of the ABC was made in 1997 where it took a team of researchers and engineers four years and $350,000 to build.<br>
      
      
      The modern personal computer emerged in the 1970s, after several breakthroughs in semiconductor technology. These include the first <br>
      working transistor by William Shockley, John Bardeen and Walter Brattain at Bell Labs in 1947,[9] the silicon surface passivation process (via thermal oxidation) <br>
      by Mohamed Atalla at Bell Labs in 1957, the monolithic integrated circuit chip by Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1959,the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect<br>
       transistor (MOSFET, or MOS transistor) by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959,[14][15][16] and the single-chip microprocessor (Intel 4004) by Federico Faggin, Marcian Hoff,<br>
       Masatoshi Shima and Stanley Mazor at Intel in 1971.
