  A computer system is basically a machine that simplifies complicated tasks. It should maximize performance and reduce<br>
   costs as well as power consumption.The different components in the Computer System Architecture are Input Unit, Output<br>
    Unit, Storage Unit, Arithmetic Logic Unit, Control Unit etc.<br> <br> <br>






  Input Unit <br>
The input unit provides data to the computer system from the outside. <br>
So, basically it links the external environment with the computer. It takes <br>
data from the input devices, converts it into machine language and then loads it<br>
 into the computer system. Keyboard, mouse etc. are the most commonly used input devices.<br>

Output Unit <br>
The output unit provides the results of computer process to the users i.e it links the<br>
 computer with the external environment. Most of the output data is the form of audio or <br>
 video. The different output devices are monitors, printers, speakers, headphones etc.<br>

Storage Unit <br>
Storage unit contains many computer components that are used to store data. <br>
It is traditionally divided into primary storage and secondary storage.<br>
Primary storage is also known as the main memory and is the memory directly accessible by the CPU. <br>
Secondary or external storage is not directly accessible by the CPU. The data from secondary storage <br>
needs to be brought into the primary storage before the CPU can use it. Secondary storage contains a large amount of data permanently.<br>

Arithmetic Logic Unit<br>
All the calculations related to the computer system are performed by the arithmetic logic unit.<br>
 It can perform operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division etc. <br>
 The control unit transfers data from storage unit to arithmetic logic unit when calculations need to be performed.<br>
  The arithmetic logic unit and the control unit together form the central processing unit.<br>

Control Unit <br>
This unit controls all the other units of the computer system and so is known as its central nervous system.<br>
 It transfers data throughout the computer as required including from storage unit to central processing unit and vice versa. <br>
 The control unit also dictates how the memory, input output devices, arithmetic logic unit etc. should behave.<br>
